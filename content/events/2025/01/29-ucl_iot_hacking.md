Could you hack an IoT camera?

<!--more-->

This is a workshop run by Interrupt Labs and UCL's CyberSoc, who've kindly invited us to join them.

Please come along for a fun, hands-on session, applying hacking techniques to gain access to an IoT camera and steal merch :D

This is completely open to our members, so long as you sign-up ahead of time and let us know you're coming.
