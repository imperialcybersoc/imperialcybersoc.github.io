The importance of networking in fighting cyber security threats.

<!--more-->

Alexandra Forsyth has kindly offered to deliver an industry talk!

How are cyber security threats evolving?\
What are the key areas of industry under threat?\
And what is Alexandra's role in helping to curb these threats?

We'll be inviting [WNBiC](http://wic.doc.ic.ac.uk/) and [DoCSoc](https://docsoc.co.uk/) members to join us at this event, too!

No cyber security expertise is assumed, but is very much welcome (as per usual).
