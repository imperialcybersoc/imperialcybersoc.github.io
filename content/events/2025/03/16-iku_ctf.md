We'll be holding a joint inter-uni CTF in collaboration with KCL and UCL's respective CyberSocs :D

The details have yet to be hashed out, but this will be a beginner to intermediate CTF sometime in March, so please feel free to come along even if this is your first CTF!

Please get on [picoctf](https://picoctf.org/), [hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), and [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/) to practice and hone your skills, in preparation for IC CyberSoc's London debut :)
