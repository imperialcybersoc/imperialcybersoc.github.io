Joint CTF Competition with UCL and KCL CyberSocs!

<!--more-->

We'll be holding a joint inter-uni CTF in collaboration with KCL and UCL's respective CyberSocs :D

On Sunday 16th March, we will be running this beginner to intermediate CTF, so please feel free to come along even if this is your first CTF!

The sign-up has now closed, so unfortunately you'll no longer be able to sign-up. Those of you who successfully signed up should have received an email (on Thursday) with preliminary details and will receive an email with more specific details closer to the date.

(for those of you that weren't able to sign-up, please look forward, instead, to our internal, Summer CTF :))

This event will be held on UCL's Bloomsbury Campus, which is closest to the Warren Street, Euston Square, and Goodge Street Underground stations.

And if you've got a spare moment, get on [picoctf](https://picoctf.org/), [hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), and [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/) to practice and hone your skills, in preparation for IC CyberSoc's London debut :)
