How safe is your self-driving car?

<!--more-->

This talk, delivered by Emily, will detail the mechanisms behind how Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) work, focussing on their sensors.\
Then discussing current research on methods and techniques for exploiting these sensors, to manipulate the CAV.

Members of all levels are welcome, with a bit of prior knowledge on what an autonomous vehicle is, being helpful.
