A chill quiz social and optional barnight, with our UCL and KCL sibling societies.

If you've been waiting for the chance to showcase your Cybersecurity knowledge, learn more about Cybersecurity, or just to meet other people, this is your chance!

This event will be held in [UCL's Huntley Bar](https://studentsunionucl.org/eat-drink-shop/bars/huntley), with the following barnight going from 20:30 to whenever your social battery expires.\
The location link at the top should give you a direct Google Maps point to work with (it's just opposite Euston Square Station.

This'll be a great opportunity to get to know some students from other London universities, who you'll probably see again in future collabs :)

Closest station is Euston Square (Circle, Hammersmith & City, and Metropolitan lines), and not too far from Russell Square station, which is on the Piccadilly line (~8 stops from South Kensington).
