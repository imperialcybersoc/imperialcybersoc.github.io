We will be participating in [Snyk CTF](https://snyk.io/events/ctf/)!

<!--more-->

The plan is to book a room and accommodate anyone who wishes to participate, helping to set up teams and offering a bit of help to those that need it.

So, if you're new to CTFs, this would be a great way to try out a public CTF, where we can show you the ropes.

For those who are a bit more experienced are free to attend and form groups together to seriously compete :)
