Can you decipher all my puzzles? :)

<!--more-->

Posters and challenges have been put up around campus, each challenge leading you to the next.

I've written 8 puzzles in total, each requiring the use of some cyber security techniques; can you solve them all? :D

No previous cyber security knowledge is required for most of the challenges, just problem-solving skills and a bit of time.\
(but cyber security skills may mean that you're more familiar with some of the solution techniques)
