A chill barnight with our sibling societies at UCL and KCL. If you've been waiting for the chance to socialise with others interested in Cybersecurity, now's your chance!

<!--more-->

This event will take place in [UCL's institute bar](https://studentsunionucl.org/eat-drink-shop/bars/institute-bar), and will go from 18:00 to whenever your social battery expires.

This'll be a great opportunity to get to know some students from other London universities, who you'll probably see again in future collabs :)

Closest Station is Russell Square, which is on the Piccadilly line (~8 stops from South Kensington).
