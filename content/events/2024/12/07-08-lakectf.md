This will be a gathering of anyone who wants to participate in a CTF: we'll be competing as one big team.
<!--more-->

[LakeCTF](https://lakectf.epfl.ch/) is a large, jeopardy-style CTF, organised by [polygl0ts](https://polygl0ts.ch/) et al., that we'll be participating in.

The plan is to compete as one big team, so that there can be help and collaboration among attendees, beginners can get help with challenges that they attempt and veterans are free to take on the toughest challenges as they see fit.

This session has no target audience, so you don't need to know a programming language, but you really should :p\
Please do bring a laptop, if not you'll need to be paired up with someone who does have a laptop (though you'll probably clump into little groups throughout anyways).

Look forward to seeing you there, whether it's your first CTF or it's not your first rodeo.
