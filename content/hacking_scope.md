This very important page, for your own safety.

Hacking outside of consensual scope, without express permissions from the owner(s) of the system, is a legal offence under [The Computer Misuse Act 1990](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents).

Permission to hack systems detailed on this page, is **only** given to members of Imperial College London's Cybersecurity Society as recognised by [Imperial College Union](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/activities/a-to-z/cybersecurity)*. Should you not be a member of our society, then you do not have permission to attack any of our systems, unless given explicit, written permission by a committee member, for some reason.

*this may change in the future to members recognised by _our_ systems, should we set up our own membership system, but for now, we work in accordance with what is provided by Imperial College Union.

If you are a society member, before attempting to hack anything, know that as a member you must abide by Section 11 of [our constitution](/docs/constitution-20250227.pdf)<!-- And of course the rest of the constitution, too..-->.

## What can I hack?

Currently, we don't have that many things to be hacked. Hacking this site is fine, but the scope is very limited, since it's hosted on GitHub Pages, which we **do not** and **can not** give you permission to hack. This means that what is permitted on this site is anything that wouldn't affect the hosting infrastructure, e.g. URL attacks, and local (client-side) deconstruction of the site.

Examples of things you can't do with our site is DoS attacks, since that would impact the underlying infrastructure, as well as injection attacks, since, unless by social engineering, that would require non-consensual writing to the site's servers, which are not owned by us.

So, yes, we're sorry that there's not much to hack right now, but we hope to set up more society infrastructure in the future, most of which will need battle-testing ;)

## What can I not hack?

Anything else. We are not giving you permission to hack anything that we have not expicitly whitelisted above.
