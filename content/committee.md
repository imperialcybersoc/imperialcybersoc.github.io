### Summer Elections 2025

Most importantly, we need a President, Secretary, and Treasurer (we can't run a society without one :}).\
As a heads-up, we have a prospective candidate who will be applying for President, but if you'd like to take a crack at it, go for it (but please also consider the other principle roles, too).

**Please read the role descriptions and responsibilities** (links from role name), as these detail exactly what you'll be expected to do in those roles.

| Abbreviations used | in Role Descriptions | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CM = Committee Member | SM = Society Member | AC = Academic Chair | CC = CTF Chair |
| AEO = Academic Events Officer | CEO = CTF Events Officer | MC = Merchant | OO = Outreach Officer |
| PO = Publicity Officer | PM = Puzzlemaster | RO = Relations Officer | SR = Secretary |
| SO = Safety Officer | TO = Technical Officer | TS = Treasurer | PD/CH = President/Chair |

The Union is still doing their "all important information is in our newsletters (and not easily accessible)" nonsense...\
